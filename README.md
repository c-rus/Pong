# Pong
FGPA two-player variation of Pong   


Design and implementation of a pong video game using VHDL in Xilinx Vivado Design Suite. The game requires two players moving their paddle up or down to hit the moving ball across the screen to their opponent. The score counts up to 15 for each player, and features 2 buttons for each player to move their paddle up or down, a serve button, and a reset switch. The scores are displayed using seven segment displays and the game is outputted to a monitor using VGA signals. The targeted FPGA platform was the Xilinx Zybo Z7-10.
